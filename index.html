						Hello my name is Cyrus Keo. This page is both the first assignment for my BootCamp class. The site will also function as a benchmark for my portfolio. Included in the site will be a couple paragraphs introducing myself, a contact from to my email, and eventually links to projects.
					</p>

						I guess I'll talk about my hobbies here. I enjoy cooking, playing video games, cars, and photography. My favorite thing about cooking is that I get to eat good food of course, but cooking also serves as my creative outlet where I can try new things. Video games allow me to connect with my friends and let my mind give in to fantasy. Recently I have been getting into cars, cars interest me because they're are many diffrent cars each of which unique and allow for the owner to make it thier own. I enjoy photography becasue it also me to capture moments in the best possible way and share with friends and family.
					</p>

						My goals for this class. I guess that really what I mean is where is see and where is want this class to take me. I really want to come away from this class with a good knowlege of the material, so as to allow me to make a career out of it later, and more for right now as sort of a freelance thing.
